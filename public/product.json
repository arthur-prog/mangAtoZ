One set of graphic stories, Public Works, details massive structures being erected across a landscape. Plot is pushed aside in favor of sheer formal verve as we watch buildings, about which we know nothing, come into being. The other set of stories, Combats, is one sequence after another of elegantly choreographed battles.

The civilizations, one of which existed for each moon, developed technologically to the point where each created a Gigas, a colossal living weapon of mass destruction, as well as the Moon Crystals that could be used to control them. Using the Gigas, the civilizations warred with one another, which caused enormous environmental harm and threatened the extinction of all six civilizations. The most advanced of the civilizations, the Silver Civilization, used their Gigas to summon the Rains of Destruction, which pulled meteors from the orbiting moons and crashed them down onto the planet's surface. The catastrophic destruction stopped the rampage of the Gigas, as well as nearly destroying the other five civilizations, thus ending the war. A seal was placed on the Silver Gigas to prevent the Rains from being used again, and the Moon Crystals were hidden away.\nIn present time, the militant and tyrannical Valuan Empire, led by Empress Teodora, seeks the Moon Crystals in order to awaken the Gigas and take over the world. Valua's will is enforced through the Valuan Armada, a fleet of iron-clad warships led by senior admiral Galcian and vice admiral Ramirez under the authority of the Empress. They are primarily opposed by the Blue Rogues, a faction of Air Pirates who make it a point to harass the Armada as much as possible. Fina, a young girl from the Silver Civilization, is sent to find the Moon Crystals before the Valuans and bring them to a safe place.","productName":"Eternal Arcadia: Kuuzoku Vyse Sanjou!","img":"https:\/\/media.kitsu.io\/manga\/poster_images\/1121\/large.jpg","chapterNumber":8},{"productId":1122,"resume":"This is a Side story from the City of Darkness manhua following the lives of the red hair Xiao Ji and his boss Shi Er Shao.\n(Source: Easy Going Scans)","productName":"City of Darkness Side Story","img":"https:\/\/media.kitsu.io\/manga\/poster_images\/1122\/large.jpg","chapterNumber":4},{"productId":1123,"resume":"A collection of four short stories.
